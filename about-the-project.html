<h2 unselectable="on">Helping Professionals Practice Social Work</h2>
<p unselectable="on">As professional social workers we dedicate our working lives to help people practice and in return we recieve training and support to cope with stresses. But we aren't practicing alone. </p><p unselectable="on">Doctors, lawyers, teachers, even business executives cross into the ambiguous boundaries of social work practice when patients, clients and students can't afford medical costs, legal fees or breakfast. In addition to helping professionals, parents, friends, neighbors, strangers frequently help each other navigate frustrating healthcare and welfare systems.</p>

<h2 unselectable="on">The purpose of this community is to synthesize evidence-based best-practice across social work sectors to help more citizens help more citizens resonsibly. Becuase every citizen practicing social work –intentionally or not, full-time and on the side– deserves to learn how best to help their community.</h2>
