<p unselectable="on">As professional social workers, we choose to dedicate our working lives to social work practice and in return we recieve training comradory to cope with stresses of practice.</p>

<h2 unselectable="on">In addition to professional social work</h2>
<p unselectable="on">Many doctors, lawyers, teachers, even business executives cross into the ambiguous boundaries of social work practice
when patients, clients and students can't afford medical costs, legal fees or breakfast.</p>

<h2 unselectable="on">In addition to helping professionals</h2>
