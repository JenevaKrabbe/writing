<h1>Welcome to the <b>Citizen Social Work</b> project</h1>

<h3>Citizens practice social work in more ways than one.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Professionally and on purpose.</li>
<li>Licensed and certified.</li>
<li>Voluntarily. Court ordered.</li>
<li>Community based. Faith based.</li>
<li>In groups. With families.</li>
<li>At school. At church. In court.</li>
<li>For civil rights.</li>
<li>For food.</li>
<li>For housing.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>As professional social workers, we choose to dedicate our working lives to social work practice and in return we recieve training comradory to cope with stresses of practice.</p>

<h2>In addition to professional social work</h2>
<p>Many doctors, lawyers, teachers, even business executives cross into the ambiguous boundaries of social work practice
when patients, clients and students can't afford medical costs, legal fees or breakfast.</p>

<h2>In addition to helping professionals</h2>
<p>Still, helping professionals are not alone praciticng social work. Parents, friends, neighbors, strangers help each other navigate frustrating healthcare systems.</p>
<br>
<h2>Citizen Social Work</h2>
<h3>Space to promote evidence-based best-practices in social work to help more citizens help more citizens resonsibly.</h3> 
<p>Becuase every citizen practicing social work –intentionally or not, full-time and on the side– deserves to know the
best way to help.</p>
