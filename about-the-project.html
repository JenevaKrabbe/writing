<h1>Welcome to the <b>Citizen Social Work</b> project</h1>


<h1>Citizen Social Work
<p>Professional social workers advocate for social justice and promote positive 
social change but complex administrative and reporting routines required to operate community
services depend on funding requirements. Since funding regularly changes, administration and reporting regularly changes.
</p>
                        
                        
Citizens practice social work in more ways than one.
                        
Professionally and on purpose.
Licensed and certified.
Community focused. 
Faith based. </span>Sometimes in groups.&#160;
Sometimes for children. Sometimes for families
Sometimes for civil rights.
Sometimes for food. 
and housing.


As professional social workers, we choose to dedicate our working lives to the well-being of other human beings
and in return we recieve training to cope with the stress of practice. 
We're warned about the dangers of burnout. We spend countless hours learning about boundaries and self-care. 
Professional social workers are only one of many individuals practicing social work on a regular basis. 

Citizens practice social work
Doctors, lawyers, teachers, business executives often cross into the ambiguous boundaries of social work practice when 
patients or customers can't afford transportation, legal fees, clothing or breakfast. </h3><h3>&#160;</h3><h3>Even still, 
these helping professionals are not alone praciticng social work. Parents, children, friends, neighbors even strangers 
volunteer to help their fellow citizens navigate our frustrating social service system.

<br><h2>What is Citizen Social Work?</h2>
Open space to communicate evidence-based social work best-practices and personal experiences delivering services 
that meet human needs so every citizen practicing social work –consciously or not –deserves know what we 
know evidence based practice how to help their friends and family meet their own human needs.
